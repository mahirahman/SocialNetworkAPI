# COMP1531 Major Project

## Contents

## 1. Aims:

* To provide students with hands on experience testing, developing, and maintaining a backend server in Python.
* To develop students' problem solving skills in relation to the software development lifecycle.
* Learn to work effectively as part of a team by managing your project, planning, and allocation of responsibilities among the members of your team.
* Gain experience in collaborating through the use of a source control and other associated modern team-based tools.
* Apply appropriate design practices and methodologies in the development of their solution
* Develop an appreciation for product design and an intuition of how a typical customer will use a product.

## 2. Overview

To manage the transition from trimesters to hexamesters in 2021, UNSW has established a new focus on building an in-house digital collaboration and communication tool for groups and teams to support the high intensity learning environment.

Rather than re-invent the wheel, UNSW has decided that it finds the functionality of **<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Microsoft Teams</a>** to be nearly exactly what it needs. For this reason, UNSW has contracted out Penguin Pty Ltd (a small software business run by Hayden) to build the new product. In UNSW's attempt to try and add a lighter note to the generally fatigued and cynical student body, they have named their UNSW-based product **UNSW Streams** (or just **Streams** for short). **UNSW Streams** is the communication tool that allows you to share, communication, and collaborate to (attempt to) make streams a reality.

Penguin Pty Ltd has sub-contracted two software firms:

* BlueBottle Pty Ltd (two software developers, Andrea and Andrew, who will build the initial web-based GUI)
* YourTeam Pty Ltd (a team of talented misfits completing COMP1531 in 21T3), who will build the backend Python server

In summary, UNSW contracts Penguin Pty Ltd, who sub contracts:

* BlueBottle (Andrea and Andrew) for frontend work
* YourTeam (you and others) for backend work

Penguin Pty Ltd met with Andrea and Andrew (the frontend development team) 2 weeks ago to brief them on this project. While you are still trying to get up to speed on the requirements of this project, Andrea and Andrew understand the requirements of the project very well.

Because of this they have already specified a **common interface** for the frontend and backend to operate on. This allows both parties to go off and do their own development and testing under the assumption that both parties will comply with the common interface. This is the interface **you are required to use**.

The specific capabilities that need to be built for this project are described in the interface at the bottom. This is clearly a lot of features, but not all of them are to be implemented at once.

## 5. Iteration 3: Completing the Lifecycle

Iteration 3 builds off all of the work you've completed in iteration 2.

If you haven't completed the implementation for iteration 2, you must complete them as part of this iteration. The automarking for iteration 3 will test on a fully completed interface.

### 5.2. Running the server

To run the server you should always use the command from the root directory of your project:

```bash
python3 -m src.server
```

This will start the server on the port in the src/config.py file. All your tests should import the port number from this file.

If you get an OSError stating that the address is already in use, you can change the port in the config file to any number from 1024 to 49151. Is it likely that another student may be using your original port number.

If you get any errors relating to `flask_cors`, ensure you have installed all the necessary Python libraries for this course (the list of libraries was updated for this iteration). You can do this with:

```bash
pip3 install $(curl https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/21T3/requirements.txt)
```

Please note: For routes such as `standup/start` and `message/sendlater` you are not required to account for situations whereby the server process crashes or restarts whilst waiting. If the server ever restarts while these active "sessions" are ongoing, you can assume they are no longer happening after restart.

### 6.3. Errors for all functions

Either an `InputError` or `AccessError` is thrown when something goes wrong. All of these cases are listed in the **Interface** table. If input implies that both errors should be thrown, throw an `AccessError`.

One exception is that, even though it's not listed in the table, for all functions except `auth/register`, `auth/login`, `auth/passwordreset/request` (iteration 3) and `auth/passwordreset/reset` (iteration 3), an `AccessError` is thrown when the token passed in is invalid.

### 6.4. Valid email format

A valid email should match the following regular expression:

```
'^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}$'
```

The Python `re` (regular expression) module allows you to determine whether a string matches a regular expression. You do not need to understand regular expressions to effectively utilise the `re` module to check if the email is correct. Check [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-email-address-valid-or-not-in-python/) if you need more help.

### 6.6. Pagination

The behaviour in which channel_messages returns data is called **pagination**. It's a commonly used method when it comes to getting theoretially unbounded amounts of data from a server to display on a page in chunks. Most of the timelines you know and love - Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn - do this.

For example, in iteration 1, if we imagine a user with `auth_user_id` "12345" is trying to read messages from channel with ID 6, and this channel has 124 messages in it, 3 calls from the client to the server would be made. These calls, and their corresponding return values would be:
 * `channel_messages("12345", 6, 0) => { [messages], 0, 50 }`
 * `channel_messages("12345", 6, 50) => { [messages], 50, 100 }`
 * `channel_messages("12345", 6, 100) => { [messages], 100, -1 }`

Pagination should also apply to messages in DMs.

### 6.7. Permissions

 * Members in a channel/DM have one of two channel/DM permissions
   1) Owner of the channel/DM
   2) Members of the channel/DM
 * Streams users have two global permissions
   1) Owners (permission id 1), who can also modify other owners' permissions
   2) Members (permission id 2), who do not have any special permissions
* All Streams users are members by default, except for the very first user who signs up, who is an owner

A user's primary permissions are their global permissions (except in DMs). Then the channel/DM permissions are layered on top. For example:
* An owner of Streams has channel owner permissions in every channel they've joined. Despite obtaining owner permissions upon joining a channel, they do not become channel owners unless a channel owner adds them as one, meaning if they are removed as a global owner, they will no longer have those channel owner permissions.
* Streams owners do not have owner permissions in DMs. The only users with owner permissions in DMs are the original creators of each DM.
* A member of Streams is a member in channels they are not owners of
* A member of Streams is an owner in channels they are owners of


### 6.8. Token

Many of these functions (nearly all of them) need to be called from the perspective of a user who is logged in already. When calling these "authorised" functions, we need to know:
1) Which user is calling it
2) That the person who claims they are that user, is actually that user

We could solve this trivially by storing the user ID of the logged in user on the frontend, and every time the frontend (from Andrea and Andrew) calls your background, they just sent a user ID. This solves our first problem (1), but doesn't solve our second problem! Because someone could just "hack" the frontend and change their user id and then log themselves in as someone else.

To solve this when a user logs in or registers the backend should return a "token" (an authorisation hash) that the frontend will store and pass into most of your functions in future. When these "authorised" functions are called, those tokens returned from register/login will be passed into those functions, and from there you can check if a token or auth_user_id is valid, and determine the user ID.

Passwords must be stored in an encrypted form, and tokens must use JWTs (or similar).

### 6.9. Working with the frontend

There is a SINGLE repository available for all students at https://gitlab.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP1531/21T3/project-frontend. You can clone this frontend locally. If you'd like to modify the frontend repo (i.e. teach yourself some frontend), please FORK the repository.

If you run the frontend at the same time as your flask server is running on the backend, then you can power the frontend via your backend.

Please note: The frontend may have very slight inconsistencies with expected behaviour outlined in the specification. Our automarkers will be running against your compliance to the specification. The frontend is there for further testing and demonstration.

#### 6.9.1. Example implementation

A working example of the frontend can be used at http://streams-unsw.herokuapp.com/. This is not a gospel implementation that dictates the required behaviour for all possible occurrences; our implementation will make reasonable assumptions just as yours will, and they might be different, and that's fine.

The data is reset occasionally, but you can use this link to play around and get a feel for how the application should behave.

#### 6.9.2. Error raising for the frontend

For errors to be appropriately raised on the frontend, they must be raised by the following:

```python
if True: # condition here
    raise InputError(description='Description of problem')
```

The quality of the descriptions will not be assessed, but you must modify your errors to this format.

The types in error.py have been modified appropriately for you.

### 6.10. User Sessions

Iteration 2 introduces the concept of `sessions`. With sessions, when a user logs in or registers, they receive a "token" (think of it like a ticket to a concert). These tokens are stored on the web browser, and nearly every time that user wants to make a request to the server, they will pass this "token" as part of this request. In this way, the server is able to take this token, look at it (like checking a ticket), and determine whether it's really you or not.

This notion of a session is explored in the authentication (Hashing) & authorisation (JWT), and is an expectation that it is implemented in iteration 2 and beyond.

For iteration 2 and beyond, we also expect you to handle multiple concurrent sessions. I.E. One user can log in on two different browser tabs, click logout on tab 1, but still functionally use the website on tab 2.

### 6.11. Tagging users

A user is tagged when a message contains the @ symbol, followed immediately by the user’s handle. The end of the handle is signified by the end of the message, or a non-alphanumeric character. If the handle is invalid, or the user is not a member of the channel or DM, no one is tagged.

Tagging should also occur when messages are edited to contain tags and when the message/share optional message contains tags.

### 6.12. Analytics

Andrea and Andrew have implemented analytics pages for users and for the Streams workspace on the frontend and need data. Your task is to add to your backend functionality that keeps track of these metrics:

For users:
  * The number of channels the user is a part of
  * The number of DMs the user is a part of
  * The number of messages the user has sent
  * The user's involvement, as defined by this pseudocode: `sum(num_channels_joined, num_dms_joined, num_msgs_sent)/sum(num_channels, num_dms, num_msgs)`. If the denominator is 0, involvement should be 0. If the involvement is greater than 1, it should be capped at 1.

For the Streams workspace:
  * The number of channels that exist currently
  * The number of DMs that exist currently
  * The number of messages that exist currently
  * The workspace's utilization, which is a ratio of the number of users who have joined at least one channel/DM to the current total number of users, as defined by this pseudocode: `num_users_who_have_joined_at_least_one_channel_or_dm / num_users`

As UNSW is very interested in its users' engagement, the analytics must be **time-series data**. This means every change to the above metrics (excluding `involvement_rate` and `utilization_rate`) must be timestamped, rather than just the most recent change. For users, the first data point should be 0 for all metrics at the time that their account was created. Similarly, for the workspace, the first data point should be 0 for all metrics at the time that the first user registers.

For users, the number of channels and DMs that they have joined can increase and decrease over time, however the number of messages sent will only increase (the removal of messages does not affect it).

For the workspace, `num_msgs` is the number of messages that exist at the current time, and should decrease when messages are removed. `num_channels` will never decrease as there is no way to remove channels, and `num_dms` will only decrease when `dm/remove` is called.

In addition to keeping track of these metrics, you are required to implement two new endpoints, `user/stats` and `users/stats`.

### 6.13. Reacts

The only React ID currently associated with the frontend is React ID 1, which is a thumbs up. You are welcome to add more (this will require some frontend work).

### 6.14. Standups

Once standups are finished, all of the messages sent to standup/send are packaged together in *one single message* posted by *the user who started the standup* and sent as a message to the channel the standup was started in, timestamped at the moment the standup finished.

The structure of the packaged message is like this:

```txt
[message_sender1_handle]: [message1]
[message_sender2_handle]: [message2]
[message_sender3_handle]: [message3]
[message_sender4_handle]: [message4]
```

For example:

```txt
hayden: I ate a catfish
jake: I went to kmart
emily: I ate a toaster
nick: my catfish ate a kmart toaster
```

Standups can be started on the frontend by typing "/standup X", where X is the number of seconds that the standup lasts for, into the message input and clicking send.

### 6.15. profile_img_url & image uploads

For outputs with data pertaining to a user, a profile_img_url is present. When images are uploaded for a user profile, after processing them you should store them on the server such that your server now locally has a copy of the cropped image of the original file linked. Then, the profile_img_url should be a URL to the server, such as http://localhost:5001/imgurl/adfnajnerkn23k4234.jpg (a unique url you generate).

For any given user, if they have yet to upload an image, there should be a site-wide default image used.

Note: This is most likely the most challenging part of the project. Don't get lost in this, we would strongly recommend most teams complete this capability *last*.
